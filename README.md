# AED - Project 1

Please use LINUX or Windows Subsystem for Linux to compile and run the executable.
To compile and execute in other ambients such as Windows natively you need to use ming32-make or a software with automatic Makefile support such as CLion.

## Compile

make
```

## Clear all binaries (Linux only)
```
make fclean
```

## Execute (using a terminal)
Linux:
```
./schedules
```
Windows:

schedules.exe
```
